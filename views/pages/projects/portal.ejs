                  Throughout this project, I dug deeper into the facets of Loopback, React, Redux, and React-Router. Our goal at the end of
                  this project was to enable students to sign up, edit their profiles, and allow employers to search for
                  students by name. Students were also able to add their work experience, education, and projects. The core
                  features I focused on were setting up the database, enabling authentication, implementing the search bar,
                  calculating a student’s profile strength, and allowing students to edit their information.

                  The front-end stack used to create our minimal viable product were React, Redux, and React-Router; styling and design was
                  implemented using Boostrap V4. For our back-end, we utilized MongoDB and mLabs for our database and our
                  API was built on top of Loopback and Express (Node.js). I implemented our routes and views with Express
                  and EJS templates for signing up or logging in. These were done in concurrence with user authentication,
                  where a user can log in or sign up with their email or with their GitHub account. I used Passport.js and
                  the loopback-component-passport module to handle the heavy lifting with managing access tokens, handling
                  handshakes, and keeping track of user identities. Front End: React / Redux / React-Router / Bootstrap /

                <p>
                  I gained a vast amount of insight working on user authentication. Where logging into your account seems to be such a small
                  portion of a user’s experience, but also one of the most crucial. Spending time thinking about how to manage
                  multiple users allowed me to deepen my understanding of databases and relations. I set up a base user model
                  that focused on handling authentication and then after a user is authenticated, queried the appropriate
                  user type model for user specific information. Working on the back-end also allowed me to learn about ACL’s
                  and handling multiple roles with an organization.

                  After completing this 3-week project, it has solidified my knowledge of working on full stack applications. We utilized various
                  open source npm modules – one favorite being redux-forms. Redux-forms allowed us to easily manage our form
                  state and ensure that our input fields were controlled, as recommended by react standards.
                  <br />
                  <br /> Some of the things that I’m learning or planning to implement in future projects: Flow or another static
                  type checker for JavaScript, TDD approach to programming – probably with Jest and Enzyme, and GraphQL as
                  an alternative to REST APIs.
